| **Description**      | It was possible to log in via Postman using only a username and password. No token or additional validation was requested. |

| **Steps to Reproduce**| 1. Include the /login endpoint in Postman.<br>2. Add valid Username and Password in the formData.<br>3. Send the request. |
