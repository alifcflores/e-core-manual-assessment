| **Title**            | No Rate Limiting for /login                               |
| **Status**           | Open                                                      |
| **Description**      | N/A                                                       |
| **The Problem**      | It is possible to perform a brute-force attack on the login route, allowing an attacker to test different password combinations using a bot. |
| **Steps to Reproduce**| Include the /login endpoint in Postman.<br>2. Add valid Username and Password in the formData.<br>3. Send the request. <br> 4. Repeat step 3 multiple times in quick succession (e.g., 50-100 times) using either a manual approach or an automated script.<br>5. Observe that there are no delays, blocks, or warnings after multiple failed login attempts. The system allows continuous attempts without any rate limiting. |
| **Severity**         | Critical                                                   |
| **Priority**         | High (vulnerability)                                       |
| **Attachments**      | N/A                                                        |
| **Suggested Solution**  | After X attempts or suspicious activity, temporarily block the IP. <br> Implement the use of CAPTCHAs. |
