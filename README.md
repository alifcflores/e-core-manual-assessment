# Scenarios Planned For Login Page
Two main software testing techniques were used to create the test scenarios.

### Equivalence partitioning
Identifies all the main inputs (usually based on the business rule) so that they can be divided into smaller partitions.

### Decision Table
In this case, the decision table is used to perform combinations between the possible inputs, to determine the real number of scenarios.

This way, it is possible to have coverage of 100% or very close to it.
